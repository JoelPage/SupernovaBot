File Structure

Main.py
- Handles Input Parameters.
- Run discord bot in online/offline mode.

Dependancies
- snBot.py

Main should include as little as possible,
preferably exclusively SupernovaBot (snBot)

snBot.py
- SupernovaBot utilises discord's bot API to provide an interface via discord commands,
to host and manage events where users can RSVP.
- Commands are executed within discord chat channels where the bot will respond
with appropriate information such as results or errors. 

Internal Modules
- snBot_Callbacks.py
    -> Contains callbacks utilising the @bot.event decorator
    -> These are typically async functions that pass varying parameters
- snBot_Commands.py
    -> Contains callback utilising the @bot.command() decorator
    -> These are typically sync functions that pass ctx and *args
- snBot_Output.py
    -> Contains functions that return messages back to discord.

Dependancies
- snCommands/ SupernovaCommands is a generic internal interface for executing commands.
- snEvents/ SupernovaEvents an internal interface for managing events.


Commands

Command results
- Results are structures returned by commands.
- Results need to be handled at the bot level as they will likely require formatting.
- Results contain two objects an Error and a Value.
- Results returned by commands should check their error before attempting to access their value.
- A Result's internal value will typically contain a dictionary of strings, usually in a Header/Body format.
